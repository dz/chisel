# About me
Hi! I make some the things that go here. I like music, science, math, mountain biking, and sci-fi and fantasy novels. I write about things that are entertaining, worrying, and most of all of personal interest.

This website is powered by Chisel, a simple python static blog generation utility by [David Zhou][dz]. It uses [jinja2][j2] for templating. I do most of my writing in [Obsidian][ob]; then I take those files and stick them into Chisel, which spits out the pages you are reading now.
